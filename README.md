With this notebook, let's have a look to the data from : https://www.kaggle.com/c/LANL-Earthquake-Prediction

The 'acoustic_data' input signal is used to predict the time remaining before the next laboratory earthquake ('time_to_failure').

In order to make this kind of prediction, we are going to run a machine learning model over statistical features extracted from the dataset. But this way, we need to select only interesting feature to save computationnal ressources. My aim here is to extract pertinent features from the dataset. For that, i have to apply a statistical analysis to the dataset. Or at least to a part of the dataset.

In this competition, you will address when the earthquake will take place. Specifically, youâ€™ll predict the time remaining before laboratory earthquakes occur from real-time seismic data. "
